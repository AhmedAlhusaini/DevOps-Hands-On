## 💡 Bonus

- Install `tree` package 
- If installed, use `tree` for a visual directory tree.  
-  Use `dirs --help` To see directory stack
- Use `pushd` and `popd` to save and restore directory positions.  
- Try `ls -lah` to see file sizes and permissions in human-readable format.  
- Explore environment variables: use `echo $HOME` vs. `cd ~`.
