# 🧠 2BashScripting — Bash Scripting Mastery Labs

Welcome to the **Bash Scripting Labs** folder of the [DevOps-Hands-On](https://github.com/AhmedAlhusaini/DevOps-Hands-On) repository! 
Where you will apply what you learned and studied after :
- Watch And Learn Any Youtube Course 
- 2BashScripting - Codes 
  - Here you will find sth that instructor use to explain concepts to you 

This module is designed to equip technical learners with essential scripting skills for Linux automation and DevOps workflows.

Each lab builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity—from environment setup and variables to advanced operations like string manipulation and array handling.

## 📚 Lab Index & Scope

| Lab No | Topic                      | File Types        | Highlights                             |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0      | Template Structure         | `.md` only        | Documentation format starter           |
| 1      | Basics & Environment       | `.md`, `.sh`      | `echo`, variables, shebangs            |
| 2      | Variables & Data Types     | `.md`, `.sh`      | `declare`, `readonly`, conversions     |
| 3      | Input/Output               | `.md`, `.sh`      | `read`, standard I/O, piping           |
| 4      | Conditional Statements     | `.md`, `.sh`      | `if`, `elif`, test conditions          |
| 5      | Loops                      | `.md`, `.sh`      | `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`    |
| 6      | Arrays                     | `.md`, `.sh`      | Declare, index access, iteration       |
| 7      | String Manipulation        | `.md`, `.sh`      | slicing, substitution, comparison      |

Each `.md` file explains the concept, and each `.sh` script walks you through its application with inline comments.
