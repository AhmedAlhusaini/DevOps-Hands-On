/etc/nginx/ - Main Configuration Directory

nginx.conf

Purpose: Main configuration file that defines global settings

Purpose: Storage for all server block configurations (virtual hosts)
Contains: Individual .conf files for each website/domain
Status: These configs are NOT active until enabled
Example files: default, example.com.conf, api.mysite.conf
sites-enabled/

Purpose: Contains active server configurations
How it works: Symbolic links to files in sites-available/
Activation: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Benefit: Easy enable/disable of sites without deleting configs
conf.d/

Purpose: Additional configuration files that are automatically included

Use case: Modular configurations, third-party configs, shared settings
Alternative: Some prefer this over sites-available/enabled structure
