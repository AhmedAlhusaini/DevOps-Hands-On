# ⚙️ DevOps-Hands-On

Hello DevOps lovers! 👋   Welcome to my hands-on DevOps learning journey. <br> 🚀 I share what I learn, step by step, so you can **learn fast and build strong**.  
🌍 From Linux to geospatial systems at scale, with “secret sauces” for working with **Esri technologies** <br>
<br>🧭 This repo is made with purpose, passion, and ❤️ in every terminal keystroke. <br>

## 🎓 About Me

I’m currently a student on a mission to master DevOps, cloud, and geospatial systems:

1. 🎓 **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** – Round 3 scholarship by MCIT Egypt, focused on **Infrastructure & Security (Cisco Enterprise Networks)**, which gave me a strong foundation and entry to an incredible DevOps & cloud community.
2. 💻 **ALX AWS Solution Archtiecture Internship** – Building Scale Solution On AWS.
3. ☁️ **DolfinED Multicloud Track** – Deep-diving into AWS & Azure with real labs.

Wish me all the best as I grow through these exciting journeys! 💪
